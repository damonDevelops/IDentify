# IDentify 

## Summary

Team IDentify presents **IDentify**, a demonstration of the potential for deploying a web application that leverages Machine Learning (ML) and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to transform customer and business interactions. IDentify facilitates transactions by processing images of ID cards, recognizing them with a trained ML model, and extracting relevant data for safe storage. The application includes a comprehensive backend API and a scalable frontend, aiming to streamline interactions and replace traditional paper forms with a more efficient solution. Future potential includes online tools for customer sign-ups with guaranteed identity verification.
