# IDentify 
## What is This Repo?
This repo is to demonstrate our finaly year university project called 'IDentify'. We developed this system over the space of 10 months with 6 developers. This system was awarded 2nd at the SCIT Tradeshow for the University of Wollongong in 2023 and is a cumulation of three years of studying Computer Science / Information Technology Respectively. The backend is quite resource intensive and this repo has simply been hosted with an archive, I make no guarantee that the frontend or backend work, rather a demonstration of my / my team's ability to work on a project similar to a professional setting and build an excellent product.


## Summary

Team IDentify presents **IDentify**, a demonstration of the potential for deploying a web application that leverages Machine Learning (ML) and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to transform customer and business interactions. IDentify facilitates transactions by processing images of ID cards, recognizing them with a trained ML model, and extracting relevant data for safe storage. The application includes a comprehensive backend API and a scalable frontend, aiming to streamline interactions and replace traditional paper forms with a more efficient solution. Future potential includes online tools for customer sign-ups with guaranteed identity verification.
